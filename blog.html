            For this assignment I faced challenges such as setting up a repository using git. I solved it by googling. Google is my best friend.
            <br>
            I learned how to use git, which is pretty cool, I already know html and css so I have no problem with the pages.
            <br>
            The most important resource is probably google. I usually open 5 tabs from google and hopefully get the relevant resources, and usually it does.
